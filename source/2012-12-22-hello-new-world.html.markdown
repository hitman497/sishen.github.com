Hey, I'm Dingding Ye. If you can see this post, you're lucky enough to be as
me to be survived when the end of world counted down. Thanks God!

I'm a father, son, husband and also Co-Founder of the
[Pragmatic.ly](https://pragmatic.ly) team. Few one cares yesterday but
I hope now it's different. As a surviver, I want to make life more
meaningful and that's the driving force to make Pragmatic.ly better
and better. I believe Tech startups are the future of the world and I hope
Pragmatic.ly can help tech startup better working on their
startups. Tell me if you hate it and why. Thanks!
